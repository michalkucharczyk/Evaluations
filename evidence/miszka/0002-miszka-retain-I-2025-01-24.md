## Evidence

The [pull request #4369](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4639) introducing the fork aware transaction pool implementation was merged. I am currently working on improving a fork-aware transaction pool to address the tasks outlined in
the follow-up [ticket](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/5472). 

Addressing the challenge of properly handling the limits of transaction pool while taking into account transaction priorities was my main focus. I also did some preliminary performance evaulation for 2s blocks, which resulted in some easy improvements in initial implementation.
